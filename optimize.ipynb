    "## Naive modeling\n",
    "The first idea that comes to mind is to make a straight forward mathematical translation of the oral problem description. That would be to set a vector of $i$ integer variables $x_{i}$, representing the number of proton fractions that should be performed to patient $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would then symbolize our input matrix as $c_{ij}$: the benefit of offering $j$ proton fractions to patient $i$. While this is a very intuitive model it suffers from a very non linear object function. In the simplest case where we would like to optimize the sum or average BED, the object functions to be maximized would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "        \\underset{x}{\\text{max}}\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A better modeling idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we would prefer to go with a linear model. For that reason we could select another set of decision variables, that is a binary matrix $x_{ij}$ where a value of 1 denotes that $j$ fractions should be performed on patient $i$. Obviously we should constraint every rows sum to 1 (a patient will receive 0,1, ... **or** N fractions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our object function can now be expressed as elegandly as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\begin{aligned}\n",
