<h1> Proton Therapy Optimization </h1>

In this project our goal is to optimally distribute a capacity of proton fractions between patients
given the benefit they are predicted to gain from each of them. 

Examples on optimization routines can be be found in the examples folder. We provide a linear programming model 
using the GUROBI optimization framework as well as a heuristic solution developed for a closely related problem.
Operation demonstrated there will be applied in our models as well.
